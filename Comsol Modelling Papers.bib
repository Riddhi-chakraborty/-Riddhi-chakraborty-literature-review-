These advantages include high efficiency, minimal environmental impact, and robust power generation capabilities, making PEMFCs highly suitable for both stationary and transportation applications.

  abstract = {The performance and durability of proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are dependent on fuel flow, humidifying water, and outgoing water management. Unlike conventional flow fields with linear channels, the complex 3D flow field—featuring repeating baffles along the channel, known as the baffle design—induces a micro-scale interface flux between the gas diffusion layer (GDL) and the flow fields. Thus, an intensive oxygen flow is created that removes excess water from the GDL, thereby improving the fuel cell efficiency. Another approach for channel design is the Turing flow field, which resembles the organization of fluid flows in natural objects such as leaves, lungs, and the blood system. This design enhances the distribution of inlet flow significantly compared with traditional designs. The present study aims to combine the advantages of both Turing and baffle flow field designs and to provide model investigations on the influence of the mixed flow field design on the efficiency of PEMFCs. It was established that the mixed design achieves the highest electrode current density of 1.2 A/cm2, outperforming the other designs. Specifically, it achieves 20\% improvement over the Turing design, reaching 1.0 A/cm2 and generating three times more current than the baffle design, which delivers 0.4 A/cm2. In contrast, the conventional serpentine designs exhibit the lowest current density. The mixed flow field design provides better oxygen utilization in the electrochemical reaction, offers optimal membrane hydration, and contributes to superior electrode current density performance. These data illustrate how flow field structure directly impacts fuel cell efficiency through enhancement of current density.},

“PEMFCs have a shorter start-up time than the other FC types, lower operating temperature (below 100 ◦C), high energy density, good efficiency with a small size, rapid power output” (Gavrailov and Boycheva, 2025, p. 1)
\par
“Despite significant progress in the development of PEMFCs, there are still a number of challenges that limit their wide practical implementation and economic viability. These limitations are related to their performance at high current densities, membrane lifetime, effective control of gas flow fields, and water optimization” (Gavrailov and Boycheva, 2025, p. 2)
\par
“The main objectives of the channel design are to maximize the flow across the FC, distributing it evenly though the porous layer to the cathode electrode. The channels need to reduce resistance to reactant flow and to enhance reaction uniformity across the entire area of the electrode surface” (Gavrailov and Boycheva, 2025, p. 2)
\par
“Improving the reactant flow through the cell leads to increasing the total reaction rate taking place in the active area, which contributes directly to the higher FC power output. By reducing the flow resistance in flow field plates, less pumping power is required for gases supplied in the cell, thereby improving overall efficiency.” (Gavrailov and Boycheva, 2025, p. 2)
\par
“A single channel configuration is the simplest flow design. This design has no issues of distributing the gas reactant and is suitable for the arrangement of small FCs. Large FCs require a longer channel length; thus, a high pressure drop occurs due to the high frictional resistance. Therefore, the serpentine configuration is a good option. The parallel straight flow field has the lowest pressure drops due to the simplicity in the structure; however, it has maldistribution flow, which reduces the chemical reaction rate taking place throughout the active area” (Gavrailov and Boycheva, 2025, p. 2)

However, the liquid water content is influenced by the temperature, inlet gas pressure and humidity, so this investigation seeks to explore the relationship among the operating parameters, liquid water content and the current density distribution that used to characterize the cell performance. Firstly, a three-dimensional monomer model of PEMFC was established for numerical simulation based the COMSOL software to study the effect of temperature and inlet gas parameters on cell performance. Then the PEMFC reactor performance test used control variable method was carried out on the 15 kW test bench to verify the research. From the simulation and test results, we can acquire that the liquid water content and current density distribution of fuel cell are the maxima under the condition of 0.2 MPa pressure and 100\% humidification. Finally, the experiment confirmed that when the temperature is 353 K, the liquid water content is the highest, and when the temperature remains constant, the higher inlet gas pressure and humidity was given, the higher liquid water content will be generated in the proton membrane which can increase the current density on the membrane to a certain extent, hence to improve the cell performance.},

The membrane water content was measured using dynamic vapor sorption (DVS) isotherms, and the temperature dependence of sorption was investigated using a new dual-mode sorption (NDMS) model, which showed an excellent fit with an adjusted coefficient of determination (Radj2) greater than 0.96. By employing the hydrogen pumping mode and polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) mode, we established empirical correlations for the coefficients of water diffusion, electro-osmotic drag (EOD), and ionic conductivity as functions of water content and cell temperature. The correlation results exhibited a maximum relative error of less than 3.14 \%. In addition, we isolated the water diffusion coefficients of the gas diffusion layer (GDL) and catalyst layer (CL) from the membrane to refine our analysis. This study enhances the understanding of water management in PEMFCs by establishing correlations for water diffusion, EOD coefficient, and ionic conductivity. These findings underscore the potential of reinforced composite membranes in advancing fuel cell technology by optimizing water transport, which is crucial for improving fuel cell performance and enabling more precise PEMFC modeling.},

The influences of different cooling patterns on the performances of PEMFC are explored. Results reveal that different gas flow patterns have roughly the same effect on the temperature distribution of the membrane in the case of the cooling water counter-current flowing. Under the counter-current gas flow pattern, pattern 3 is the best cooling pattern, that is to keep the cooling water flow direction consistent with the cathode gas flow direction. Under the co-current gas flow pattern, pattern 6 is the best cooling pattern, that is to keep the cooling water flow direction consistent with the gas flow direction. Meanwhile, the temperature distribution of the cathode and the anode is basically symmetrical at the interface of the cathode gas diffusion layer and the cathode catalyst layer. Additionally, the optimal cooling patterns need to ensure the cooling water co-current flowing, and it has obvious advantages of system integration and cost reduction.},

“As can be noticed from Fig. 2, the difference in performance at the air velocity of 1 m/s and 1.3 m/s is mainly attributed to the concentration polarization, which normally occurs at higher current densities. The rapid electrochemical reactions at higher current densities cause a starvation situation for the reactants species at the catalyst layer. It creates an imbalance between the consumption and supply of the reactants, which is mostly regulated by the inflow of reactants through the flow channels and diffusion impelled reactants’ flow through GDL.” (Mohanty et al., 2021, p. 20656)

\par
“On the contrary, a slight increment in the mass fraction of H2 is observed towards the flow channel outlet from Fig. 4(a), which indicates a flow across the adjacent channels. As the diffusion rate of H2 is higher than air, a small concentration gradient between adjacent channels can transport the reactants through GDL.” (Mohanty et al., 2021, p. 20657)

“In this work, it has been assumed that there is no reactant cross-over through the membrane. Hence, the effect of membrane thickness on the reactant distribution becomes negligible as compared to its effect on the ohmic resistance, which can only be identified by the current-voltage relation (polarization plot)” (Mohanty et al., 2021, p. 20659)

“Initially, a sharp decline in cell potential is noticed at a low current density below 1000 A/m2 from Fig. 9, which depicts the activation loss in PEMFC.

Finally, the voltage drops sharply at the higher current densities above 10,000 A/m2,” (Mohanty et al., 2021, p. 20659)

A 1D multi-plate heat transfer model based on the temperature data of the separator measured using the thermograph in a power generation experiment was developed to evaluate the reaction surface temperature (Treact). In addition, to validate the proposed heat transfer model, Treact obtained from the model was compared with that from the 3D numerical simulation using CFD software COMSOL Multiphysics which solves the continuity equation, Brinkman equation, Maxwell-Stefan equation, Butler-Volmer equation as well as heat transfer equation. As a result, the temperature gap between the results obtained by 1D heat transfer model and those obtained by 3D numerical simulation is below approximately 0.5 K. The simulation results show the change in the molar concentration of O2 and H2O from the inlet to the outlet is more even with the increase in Tini due to the lower performance of O2 reduction reaction. The change in the current density from the inlet to the outlet is more even with the increase in Tini and the value of current density is smaller with the increase in Tini due to the increase in ohmic over-potential and concentration over-potential. It is revealed that the change in Treact from the inlet to the outlet is more even with the increase in Tini irrespective of heat transfer model. This is because the generated heat from the power generation is lower with the increase in Tini due to the lower performance of O2 reduction reaction.},

The effect of the initial temperature of the cell (Tini) is also investigated by the numerical simulation using the 3D model by COMSOL Multiphysics. As a result, the current density decreases along with the gas flow through the gas channel irrespective of the Nafion membrane thickness and Tini, which can be explained by the concentration distribution of H2 and O2 consumed by electrochemical reaction. The molar concentration of H2O decreases when the thickness of Nafion membrane increases, irrespective of Tini and the relative humidity of the supply gas. The current density increases with the increase in relative humidity of the supply gas, irrespective of the Nafion membrane thickness and Tini. This study recommends that a thinner Nafion membrane with well-humidified supply gas would promote high power generation at the target temperature of 363 K and 373 K.},

Under wet operating conditions, liquid water may condense in the channel, gas diffusion layer, or electrode, which introduces complicated transport phenomena. In this work, we present a physics-based, steady-state, 1-D, non-isothermal, and two-phase PEMFC model that captures the interactive nature of gas and liquid transports to simulate fuel cell performance. Limiting current experiments are employed to study both dry and wet oxygen transport resistances of TorayH-060 carbon fiber paper with PTFE impregnation and a microporous layer. A two-phase model based on limiting current diagnostics is proposed to simulate water transport in the gas diffusion layer using tendril length to represent liquid water penetration. This newly constructed model is capable of predicting the total transport resistance under dry, transition, and wet regions. In addition, an empirical catalyst utilization model is proposed to correlate the electrode water activity with catalyst utilization. The two-phase electrode model provides key insights into the relationship between catalyst utilization and electrode flooding. The newly developed 1-D two-phase model is highly efficient in predicting PEMFC performance under a wide range of operating conditions and the empirical approach can be applied and adopted to studies with novel materials and designs.},

  abstract = {The thermal contact resistance (TCR) is the main component of proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) thermal resistance due to the existence of surface roughness between the components of PEMFC, and the influence of TCR is often ignored in traditional three dimensional PEMFC simulations. In this paper, the heat and mass transfer characteristics including polarization curve, power density curve, temperature distribution, membrane water content distribution, membrane current density are studied under different component surface roughness conditions, and finally the effect of each TCR on the PEMFC performance is studied. It is found that under the same operating conditions, the TCR makes the radial heat transfer of the PEMFC decrease, and the temperature of the membrane electrode and the temperature difference of each component of the PEMFC is higher than that of the model without TCR. When the surface roughness of components in the PEMFC equals 1 mm, 2 mm, 3 mm, the cell current density decreases by 6.56\%, 12.46\% and 17.17\% respectively when the output cell voltage equals 0.3 V, and the cell power density decreases by 3.64\%, 7.54\%, 13.14\% respectively when the cell current density equals 1.2 A\$cm 2. When the TCR between the CL and PEM equals 0.003 K\$m2\$W 1, 0.005 K\$m2\$W 1, 0.01 K\$m2\$W 1, the cell current density is increased by 2.30\%, 3.65\%, 6.74\% respectively under the condition that the output cell voltage equals 0.3 V, and the cell power density is increased by 1.24\%, 1.85\%, 3.10\% respectively when the cell current density equals 1.2 A\$cm 2.

There is a large need for standardization and establishing a common ground not only in experimental characterization of fuel cells, but also in the development of simulation codes, to prevent each research group from having to start anew from scratch. Here, we publish the first open standalone implementation of a full-blown, steady-state, non-isothermal two-phase model for low-temperature PEM fuel cells. It is based on macro-homogeneous modeling approaches and implements the most essential through-plane transport processes in a five-layer MEA. The focus is on code simplicity and compactness with only a few hundred lines of clearly readable code, providing a starting point for more complex model development. The model is implemented as a standalone MATLAB function, based on MATLAB’s standard boundary value problem solver. The default simulation setup reflects wide-spread commercially available MEA materials. Operating conditions recommended for automotive applications by the European Commission are used to establish new fuel cell simulation base data, making our program a valuable candidate for model comparison, validation and benchmarking.

  abstract = {The performance of high-temperature PEM fuel cell (HT-PEMFC) is substantially influenced by physical parameters. In this work, the effects of three parameters on the performance of HT-PEMFC are studied by using a 3D model in COMSOL. The parameters are the operating temperature, membrane's thickness and catalyst layer's thickness. The polarization curves are adopted to analyze the effects on the performance. The results show that the increase of temperature can enhance the performance of fuel cell. For the effect of catalyst layer thickness, the cell performance is promoted as the catalyst layer's thickness decreases. For the effect of the thickness of membrane, it is found that the thinner membrane of fuel cell can achieve better performance. These findings can be further extended to guide the operation and design of HT-PEMFC in practical applications.},

  abstract = {Wide ranges of thickness (e.g. 100–400~μm) and porosity (e.g. 30–70\%) of gas diffusion layer (GDL) in a high temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell (HT-PEMFC) are available in the literature. However, the effects of GDL porosity and thickness on electron conduction and gas distribution uniformity (under the rib and under the channel) are unclear. In this study, a numerical non-isothermal 3D model was developed. After model validation, parametric analyses were performed to investigate the effects of thickness and porosity on flow uniformity (under the rib and under the channel), diffusion flux and ohmic resistance. It is found that both the flow uniformity and ohmic resistance increase with increasing thickness and porosity. However, the thickness and porosity have opposite influence on diffusion flux, which decreases with increasing GDL thickness but increases with increasing porosity. Unlike the previous research suggesting thin GDL with high porosity, optimal GDL thickness and porosity are found in the present study. The appropriate GDL thicknesses for anode and cathode are 80–120~μm and 140–170~μm respectively while the optimal value for GDL porosity is 35–45\%. This study clearly demonstrates that we can further achieve a performance increment of 7.7\% by carefully controlling the thickness and porosity of GDL.},
