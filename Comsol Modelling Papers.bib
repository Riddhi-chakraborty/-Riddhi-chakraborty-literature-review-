  abstract = {This work is to study the effect of properties of gas diffusion layer (GDL) on performance in a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) by both numerical simulation and experiments. The 1-dimension numerical simulation using the mixture-phase model is developed to calculate polarization curve. We are able to estimate optimum GDL properties for cell performance from numerical simulation results. Various GDLs which have different properties are prepared to verify accuracy of the simulation results. The contact angle and gas permeability of GDLs are controlled by polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) content in microporous layers (MPLs). MPL slurry is prepared by homogeneous blending of carbon powder, PTFE suspension, isopropyl alcohol and glycerol. Then the slurry is coated on gas diffusion mediums (GDMs) surface with controlled thickness by blade coating method. Non-woven carbon papers which have different thicknesses of 200 mm and 380 mm are used as GDMs. The prepared GDLs are measured by surface morphology, contact angle, gas permeability and through-plane electrical resistance. Moreover, the GDLs are tested in a 25 cm2 single cell at 70 C in humidified H2/air condition. The contact angle of GDL increases with increasing PTFE content in MPL. However, the gas permeability and through-plane electrical conductivity decrease with increasing PTFE content and thickness of GDM. These changes in properties of GDL greatly influence the cell performance. As a result, the best performance is obtained by GDL consists of 200 mm thick non-woven carbon paper as GDM and MPL contained 20 wt.\% PTFE content.},

“The contact angles of self-made GDLs are shown in Fig. 6. The PTFE provides high hydrophobicity to avoid water flooding [28], thus contact angle of GDL increases with increasing the PTFE content in the MPL” (Chun et al., 2011, p. 1841)

The electrical resistance is proportional to length of electron pathway, thus, throughplane resistance increased with increasing GDM thickness. In addition, the resistance of GDL increases with increasing PTFE content. This increase in resistance was due to the formation barriers in the electron pathway by PTFE, which is an insulating material.” (Chun et al., 2011, p. 1841)

“As mentioned above, the hydrophobicity of MPL is dependent on the PTFE content in MPL. The higher the content of PTFE contained in MPL, the more hydrophobic and micro pores the MPL surface will be, and the less the electrode will be flooded. Hence, the concentration losses due to water flooding will be decreased by increasing the PTFE content in MPL.” (Chun et al., 2011, p. 1843)

Hydrogen crossover, i.e., the undesired diffusion of the gas from the anode to the cathode through the membrane, has been ascribed as one of the main causes of deterioration of perfluorinated ionomer membranes, normally employed in PEMFCs. One of the effects of the hydrogen permeation across the membrane is the decrease of the cell’s open circuit voltage (OCV), due to the reaction between the fuel and the oxidant at the cathode surface. Such reaction can lead to the production of peroxide radicals, causing the degradation of both the PEM and the catalyst layer. Hydrogen crossover increases when temperature, pressure and humidity of the cell rise. The hydrogen permeation rate through a very thin PEM is typically lower than 1 mA cm−2 for a new MEA, but it can exceed 10–20 mA cm−2 after long term operation. Various methods have been proposed to measure the rate of hydrogen crossover, mainly based on electrochemical tests on a single FC with a flow of nitrogen at the cathode, so that the steady state current corresponds to the oxidation of crossed hydrogen. Hydrogen crossover has been also determined indirectly by assuming that the changes in the OCV values are due to the passage of fuel from the anode to the cathode.},

  abstract = {The performance and durability of proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are dependent on fuel flow, humidifying water, and outgoing water management. Unlike conventional flow fields with linear channels, the complex 3D flow field—featuring repeating baffles along the channel, known as the baffle design—induces a micro-scale interface flux between the gas diffusion layer (GDL) and the flow fields. Thus, an intensive oxygen flow is created that removes excess water from the GDL, thereby improving the fuel cell efficiency. Another approach for channel design is the Turing flow field, which resembles the organization of fluid flows in natural objects such as leaves, lungs, and the blood system. This design enhances the distribution of inlet flow significantly compared with traditional designs. The present study aims to combine the advantages of both Turing and baffle flow field designs and to provide model investigations on the influence of the mixed flow field design on the efficiency of PEMFCs. It was established that the mixed design achieves the highest electrode current density of 1.2 A/cm2, outperforming the other designs. Specifically, it achieves 20\% improvement over the Turing design, reaching 1.0 A/cm2 and generating three times more current than the baffle design, which delivers 0.4 A/cm2. In contrast, the conventional serpentine designs exhibit the lowest current density. The mixed flow field design provides better oxygen utilization in the electrochemical reaction, offers optimal membrane hydration, and contributes to superior electrode current density performance. These data illustrate how flow field structure directly impacts fuel cell efficiency through enhancement of current density.},

“PEMFCs have a shorter start-up time than the other FC types, lower operating temperature (below 100 ◦C), high energy density, good efficiency with a small size, rapid power output” (Gavrailov and Boycheva, 2025, p. 1)
\par
“Despite significant progress in the development of PEMFCs, there are still a number of challenges that limit their wide practical implementation and economic viability. These limitations are related to their performance at high current densities, membrane lifetime, effective control of gas flow fields, and water optimization” (Gavrailov and Boycheva, 2025, p. 2)
\par
“The main objectives of the channel design are to maximize the flow across the FC, distributing it evenly though the porous layer to the cathode electrode. The channels need to reduce resistance to reactant flow and to enhance reaction uniformity across the entire area of the electrode surface” (Gavrailov and Boycheva, 2025, p. 2)
\par
“Improving the reactant flow through the cell leads to increasing the total reaction rate taking place in the active area, which contributes directly to the higher FC power output. By reducing the flow resistance in flow field plates, less pumping power is required for gases supplied in the cell, thereby improving overall efficiency.” (Gavrailov and Boycheva, 2025, p. 2)
\par
“A single channel configuration is the simplest flow design. This design has no issues of distributing the gas reactant and is suitable for the arrangement of small FCs. Large FCs require a longer channel length; thus, a high pressure drop occurs due to the high frictional resistance. Therefore, the serpentine configuration is a good option. The parallel straight flow field has the lowest pressure drops due to the simplicity in the structure; however, it has maldistribution flow, which reduces the chemical reaction rate taking place throughout the active area” (Gavrailov and Boycheva, 2025, p. 2)

To comprehensively investigate the internal processes of PEMFCs, an improved two-phase non-isothermal model based on heat and water transfer mechanisms inside the fuel cell is developed. The results show that the model proposed in this work can predict the fuel cell’s performance accurately and is capable of exploring water and heat transfer phenomena inside fuel cells. Additionally, the water and heat transfer of cathodes and anodes under different relative humidity and temperatures are studied. It can be concluded that when the PEMFC operates under a constant voltage, the anode water content gradually increases, while the cathode water content gradually decreases. The maximum water content occurs at the interface between cathode catalyst layer and cathode gas diffusion layer, while the minimum value is attained at the interface between anode catalyst layer and anode gas diffusion layer. When the fuel cell operates at 0.75 V, although the water content of CCL is the highest, no back-diffusion of dissolved water occurs.},

Firstly, a three-dimensional monomer model of PEMFC was established for numerical simulation based the COMSOL software to study the effect of temperature and inlet gas parameters on cell performance. Then the PEMFC reactor performance test used control variable method was carried out on the 15 kW test bench to verify the research. From the simulation and test results, we can acquire that the liquid water content and current density distribution of fuel cell are the maxima under the condition of 0.2 MPa pressure and 100\% humidification. Finally, the experiment confirmed that when the temperature is 353 K, the liquid water content is the highest, and when the temperature remains constant, the higher inlet gas pressure and humidity was given, the higher liquid water content will be generated in the proton membrane which can increase the current density on the membrane to a certain extent, hence to improve the cell performance.},

The effects of five CCL design parameters are investigated. It is found that the Pt loading of CCL has a significant effect on the performance, a low platinum (Pt) loading is more likely to cause oxygen starvation. The increase of Pt/C ratio can promote the performance significantly at a lower Pt/C ratio. A lower I/C ratio is good for the enhancement of limiting current density, a larger I/C ratio is good for the increase of maximum power density, and the increase in I/C ratio is better for the uniformity of membrane water distribution. With the decrease of carbon particle radius, the oxygen concentration on the Pt surface of CCL increases significantly. The increase of electrochemical specific area (ECSA) of Pt particles can promote the performance. In addition, a discussion on applicability of new correlations of capillary pressure-water saturation and effective diffusivity and their effects on the predicted PEMFC performance is presented.},

Utilizing COMSOL Multiphysics software, the model provides insights into the stack's dynamic behavior across varying conditions. It is found that as the operating voltage decreases, both hydrogen and oxygen consumption increase, leading to higher temperature gradients and more significant water production. These effects are especially pronounced at 0.55 V, where efficient cooling and water management become critical to avoid overheating and water flooding. The results demonstrate that optimal operating conditions are essential for balancing performance and durability, providing valuable data for the design and operation of fuel cell systems in practical applications.},

  abstract = {This study presents a comprehensive in-situ analysis of water transport properties through an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE)-reinforced composite membrane, representing a notable advancement over previous studies that primarily focused on Nafion membranes. The membrane water content was measured using dynamic vapor sorption (DVS) isotherms, and the temperature dependence of sorption was investigated using a new dual-mode sorption (NDMS) model, which showed an excellent fit with an adjusted coefficient of determination (Radj2) greater than 0.96. By employing the hydrogen pumping mode and polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) mode, we established empirical correlations for the coefficients of water diffusion, electro-osmotic drag (EOD), and ionic conductivity as functions of water content and cell temperature. The correlation results exhibited a maximum relative error of less than 3.14 \%. In addition, we isolated the water diffusion coefficients of the gas diffusion layer (GDL) and catalyst layer (CL) from the membrane to refine our analysis. This study enhances the understanding of water management in PEMFCs by establishing correlations for water diffusion, EOD coefficient, and ionic conductivity. These findings underscore the potential of reinforced composite membranes in advancing fuel cell technology by optimizing water transport, which is crucial for improving fuel cell performance and enabling more precise PEMFC modeling.},

The developed model is validated with experimental results and it shows the modified model can more accurately simulate actual working conditions of PEMFC at medium and high current density. The influences of different cooling patterns on the performances of PEMFC are explored. Results reveal that different gas flow patterns have roughly the same effect on the temperature distribution of the membrane in the case of the cooling water counter-current flowing. Under the counter-current gas flow pattern, pattern 3 is the best cooling pattern, that is to keep the cooling water flow direction consistent with the cathode gas flow direction. Under the co-current gas flow pattern, pattern 6 is the best cooling pattern, that is to keep the cooling water flow direction consistent with the gas flow direction. Meanwhile, the temperature distribution of the cathode and the anode is basically symmetrical at the interface of the cathode gas diffusion layer and the cathode catalyst layer. Additionally, the optimal cooling patterns need to ensure the cooling water co-current flowing, and it has obvious advantages of system integration and cost reduction.},

“As can be noticed from Fig. 2, the difference in performance at the air velocity of 1 m/s and 1.3 m/s is mainly attributed to the concentration polarization, which normally occurs at higher current densities. The rapid electrochemical reactions at higher current densities cause a starvation situation for the reactants species at the catalyst layer. It creates an imbalance between the consumption and supply of the reactants, which is mostly regulated by the inflow of reactants through the flow channels and diffusion impelled reactants’ flow through GDL.” (Mohanty et al., 2021, p. 20656)

“On the contrary, a slight increment in the mass fraction of H2 is observed towards the flow channel outlet from Fig. 4(a), which indicates a flow across the adjacent channels. As the diffusion rate of H2 is higher than air, a small concentration gradient between adjacent channels can transport the reactants through GDL.” (Mohanty et al., 2021, p. 20657)

“In this work, it has been assumed that there is no reactant cross-over through the membrane.

“Initially, a sharp decline in cell potential is noticed at a low current density below 1000 A/m2 from Fig. 9, which depicts the activation loss in PEMFC.

Finally, the voltage drops sharply at the higher current densities above 10,000 A/m2,” (Mohanty et al., 2021, p. 20659)

A 1D multi-plate heat transfer model based on the temperature data of the separator measured using the thermograph in a power generation experiment was developed to evaluate the reaction surface temperature (Treact). In addition, to validate the proposed heat transfer model, Treact obtained from the model was compared with that from the 3D numerical simulation using CFD software COMSOL Multiphysics which solves the continuity equation, Brinkman equation, Maxwell-Stefan equation, Butler-Volmer equation as well as heat transfer equation. As a result, the temperature gap between the results obtained by 1D heat transfer model and those obtained by 3D numerical simulation is below approximately 0.5 K. The simulation results show the change in the molar concentration of O2 and H2O from the inlet to the outlet is more even with the increase in Tini due to the lower performance of O2 reduction reaction. The change in the current density from the inlet to the outlet is more even with the increase in Tini and the value of current density is smaller with the increase in Tini due to the increase in ohmic over-potential and concentration over-potential. It is revealed that the change in Treact from the inlet to the outlet is more even with the increase in Tini irrespective of heat transfer model. This is because the generated heat from the power generation is lower with the increase in Tini due to the lower performance of O2 reduction reaction.},

The molar concentration of H2O decreases when the thickness of Nafion membrane increases, irrespective of Tini and the relative humidity of the supply gas. The current density increases with the increase in relative humidity of the supply gas, irrespective of the Nafion membrane thickness and Tini.

Under wet operating conditions, liquid water may condense in the channel, gas diffusion layer, or electrode, which introduces complicated transport phenomena. In this work, we present a physics-based, steady-state, 1-D, non-isothermal, and two-phase PEMFC model that captures the interactive nature of gas and liquid transports to simulate fuel cell performance. Limiting current experiments are employed to study both dry and wet oxygen transport resistances of TorayH-060 carbon fiber paper with PTFE impregnation and a microporous layer. A two-phase model based on limiting current diagnostics is proposed to simulate water transport in the gas diffusion layer using tendril length to represent liquid water penetration. This newly constructed model is capable of predicting the total transport resistance under dry, transition, and wet regions. In addition, an empirical catalyst utilization model is proposed to correlate the electrode water activity with catalyst utilization. The two-phase electrode model provides key insights into the relationship between catalyst utilization and electrode flooding. The newly developed 1-D two-phase model is highly efficient in predicting PEMFC performance under a wide range of operating conditions and the empirical approach can be applied and adopted to studies with novel materials and designs.},

  abstract = {Gas diffusion layers (GDL) are one of the important parts of the PEM fuel cell as they serve to transport the reactant gases to the catalyst layer. Porosity of this layer has a large effect on the PEM fuel cell performance. The spatial variation in porosity arises due to two effects: (1) compression of the electrode on the solid landing areas and (2) water produced at the cathode side of gas diffusion layers. Both of these factors change the porosity of gas diffusion layers and affect the fuel cell performance. To implement this performance analysis, a mathematical model which considers oxygen and hydrogen mass fraction in gas diffusion layer and the electrical current density in the catalyst layer, and the fuel cell potentials are investigated. The porosity variation in the GDL is calculated by considering the applied pressure and the amount of the water generated in the cell. The validity of the model is approved by comparing the computed results with experimental data. The obtained results show that the decrease in the average porosity causes the reduction in oxygen consumption, so that a lower electrical current density is generated. It is also shown that when the electrical current density is low, the porosity variation in gas diffusion layer has no significant influence on the level of polarization whereas at higher current density the influence is very significant. The porosity variation causes non-uniformity in the mass transport which in turn reduces the current density and a lower fuel cell performance is obtained.},

  abstract = {This study uses the finite element technique to analyse a multi-dimensional model for a polyelectrolyte membrane fuel cell at high working temperature. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique implements and solves this model. In addition, the membrane’s thickness, and catalyst layer’s thickness parameters have been studied. Membrane thickness is varied from to and the length of the fuel cell from to. The performance of the fuel cell was studied, analysed, and discussed for each case using the polarization curves and output power. The results indicate that the performance of fuel cells is enhanced by a thinner membrane than a thicker one with an increase in loading. The performance is approximated at light loads. Furthermore, the concentration of water at the cathode side of the fuel cell is highly affected by the change in fuel cell length more than the thickness of the membrane. Comparative analysis with prior research demonstrates strong agreement with our consequences.},

  abstract = {The thermal contact resistance (TCR) is the main component of proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) thermal resistance due to the existence of surface roughness between the components of PEMFC, and the influence of TCR is often ignored in traditional three dimensional PEMFC simulations. In this paper, the heat and mass transfer characteristics including polarization curve, power density curve, temperature distribution, membrane water content distribution, membrane current density are studied under different component surface roughness conditions, and finally the effect of each TCR on the PEMFC performance is studied. It is found that under the same operating conditions, the TCR makes the radial heat transfer of the PEMFC decrease, and the temperature of the membrane electrode and the temperature difference of each component of the PEMFC is higher than that of the model without TCR. When the surface roughness of components in the PEMFC equals 1 mm, 2 mm, 3 mm, the cell current density decreases by 6.56\%, 12.46\% and 17.17\% respectively when the output cell voltage equals 0.3 V, and the cell power density decreases by 3.64\%, 7.54\%, 13.14\% respectively when the cell current density equals 1.2 A\$cm 2. When the TCR between the CL and PEM equals 0.003 K\$m2\$W 1, 0.005 K\$m2\$W 1, 0.01 K\$m2\$W 1, the cell current density is increased by 2.30\%, 3.65\%, 6.74\% respectively under the condition that the output cell voltage equals 0.3 V, and the cell power density is increased by 1.24\%, 1.85\%, 3.10\% respectively when the cell current density equals 1.2 A\$cm 2.

The results demonstrate that the performance of the cell is improved by modifying temperature and operating pressure. Current density is shown to degrade with the rising temperature as explored in this study. The findings show that at 353 K, the current density decreases by 28\% compared to that at 323 K. In contrast, studies have shown that totally humidified gas passing through the gas channel results in a 10\% higher current density yield, and that an evaluation of a 19\% higher RCD value results in a similar current density yield.},

  abstract = {Hydrogen-oxygen proton exchange membrane fuel cell (H2/O2 PEMFC) is a typical fuel cell for the applications of air-free environments, such as aerospace and underwater. Gas crossover has an adverse effect on the cell performance especially on open-circuit voltage (OCV), and this phenomenon would be severe for H2/O2 PEMFC. In this study, we develop a H2/O2 PEMFC model considering hydrogen and oxygen crossover, and investigate the gas crossover effect on H2/O2 PEMFC, and effects of temperature, relative humidity, inlet pressure and membrane thickness. The numerical results show that the gas crossover effect on the cell performance is obvious in the low current density region, and this effect becomes weak with current density. Although the crossover flux rate of hydrogen is generally greater than that of oxygen, the crossover current density of oxygen could be greater than that of hydrogen. Increasing temperature and relative humidity will decrease the OCV, and increase hydrogen and oxygen crossover current density. The temperature effect on OCV is more obvious at high relative humidity conditions. Increasing inlet pressure only slightly increases the OCV with considering the gas crossover effect. The OCV increases with increasing membrane thickness, and this positive effect becomes weak when the membrane thickness is greater than 75 μm in the investigated range. The work illustrates the basic influence rules and some quantified results of the critical parameters on the gas crossover effect and OCV of H2/O2 PEMFC.},

In this study, a two-dimensional multiphase transient PEMFC model is developed to investigate the purge strategy of the PEMFC with DEA and DEC. This model is well validated with the experimental data. The simulation results show that the voltage increases to a certain extent at the beginning of the dead-ended operation and then decreases gradually. During the purging period, the voltage reaches a peak value and then decreases. Therefore, the optimal purge duration is defined as the purge stops when the voltage reaches the maximum value, and the optimal purge duration decreases with the increase of scavenging velocity and increases with the increase of voltage drop rate, however, the energy efficiency under the optimal purge duration is not the highest. Besides, compared with the purging anode and cathode operation, the peak value of the purging cathode operation decreases gradually. Compared with the counter-flow operation, the co-flow operation leads to earlier purging moment, larger ohmic resistance, and voltage decay rate. The excessive accumulation of liquid water leads to a more poor uniformity of the local current density distribution. The purging cathode and counter-flow operation is the most ideal purge strategy during short-time operation, due to the highest energy efficiency about 52.3\%, the second-highest output performance, and the second-longest purge interval about 180.01 s.},

There is a large need for standardization and establishing a common ground not only in experimental characterization of fuel cells, but also in the development of simulation codes, to prevent each research group from having to start anew from scratch. Here, we publish the first open standalone implementation of a full-blown, steady-state, non-isothermal two-phase model for low-temperature PEM fuel cells. It is based on macro-homogeneous modeling approaches and implements the most essential through-plane transport processes in a five-layer MEA. The focus is on code simplicity and compactness with only a few hundred lines of clearly readable code, providing a starting point for more complex model development. The model is implemented as a standalone MATLAB function, based on MATLAB’s standard boundary value problem solver. The default simulation setup reflects wide-spread commercially available MEA materials. Operating conditions recommended for automotive applications by the European Commission are used to establish new fuel cell simulation base data, making our program a valuable candidate for model comparison, validation and benchmarking.

However, the effects of GDL porosity and thickness on electron conduction and gas distribution uniformity (under the rib and under the channel) are unclear. In this study, a numerical non-isothermal 3D model was developed. After model validation, parametric analyses were performed to investigate the effects of thickness and porosity on flow uniformity (under the rib and under the channel), diffusion flux and ohmic resistance. It is found that both the flow uniformity and ohmic resistance increase with increasing thickness and porosity. However, the thickness and porosity have opposite influence on diffusion flux, which decreases with increasing GDL thickness but increases with increasing porosity. Unlike the previous research suggesting thin GDL with high porosity, optimal GDL thickness and porosity are found in the present study. The appropriate GDL thicknesses for anode and cathode are 80–120~μm and 140–170~μm respectively while the optimal value for GDL porosity is 35–45\%. This study clearly demonstrates that we can further achieve a performance increment of 7.7\% by carefully controlling the thickness and porosity of GDL.},

“It is found that both the flow uniformity and ohmic resistance increase with increasing thickness and porosity.” (Xia et al., 2021, p. 1)
\par
“The appropriate GDL thicknesses for anode and cathode are 80–120 μm and 140–170 μm respectively while the optimal value for GDL porosity is 35–45\%.” (Xia et al., 2021, p. 1)

“To numerically calculate the cell performance, parametric sweep was used with the cathode boundary potential varying from 0.9 V to 0.4 V. The potential interval was 0.1 V.” (Xia et al., 2021, p. 5)
\par
“When changing anode or cathode GDL thickness individually, the GDL thickness of the other side remains 380 μm” (Xia et al., 2021, p. 5)
\par
“With a cathode GDL thickness of 20 μm, the oxygen concentration could even be reduced to zero, which is unacceptable in the operation of fuel cell. One interesting finding of this study is that the gas distribution uniformity can be significantly improved with increasing GDL thickness, especially at the cathode side.” (Xia et al., 2021, p. 5)

“To quantify this effect of GDL thickness on gas distribution uniformity, a standard index γ representing the flow uniformity by Weltens” (Xia et al., 2021, p. 6)

“a thicker GDL would result in a larger ohmic resistance.” (Xia et al., 2021, p. 7)
\par
“In this thickness range, as the diffusion resistance and ohmic loss are both low, the cell performance was improved consequently.” (Xia et al., 2021, p. 7)
\par
“When the thickness of anode GDL is further” (Xia et al., 2021, p. 7)
\par
“increased to be higher than 100 μm, the cell performance is found to decrease gradually, which is caused by a higher ohmic loss and lower diffusion flux (higher diffusion resistance).” (Xia et al., 2021, p. 8)
\par
“In LT-PEMFC, it is reported that the GDL could improve the distribution uniformity of reactants [37], leading to enhanced overall cell performance. However, a too thick GDL could cause a high concentration loss, leading to performance reduction. For example, Chun et al. [38] reported lower cell performance with GDL thickness of 380 μm than that with GDL thickness of 200 μm.” (Xia et al., 2021, p. 8)
\par
“electron conduction should be affected by the GDL porosity and 100\% porosity would not allow electron conduction.” (Xia et al., 2021, p. 8)
\par
“the electrical conductivity of GDL should consider the porosity effect, which can be determined by Brugman equation” (Xia et al., 2021, p. 8)

“σeff = (1 ε)1.5⋅σ0” (Xia et al., 2021, p. 8) here epsilon = solid fraction
\par
“the current density should be 0 with GDL porosity 0\% or 100\%. This is because when porosity is 0, no gaseous reactants can be transferred to the reaction sites through the GDL while 100\% porosity means empty GDL and no solid phase for electron conduction. Thus, the whole fuel cell would be open circuit with a 100\% GDL porosity.” (Xia et al., 2021, p. 8)
\par
“Thus, the diffusion coefficient should consider the porosity effect and determined by equation” (Xia et al., 2021, p. 9)
\par
“The result shows that a higher porosity would greatly decrease the effective electron conductivity, thus leading to a larger ohmic resistance according to equation” (Xia et al., 2021, p. 9)
\par
“when the porosity increases from 0 to 40\%, a significant performance improvement is observed (see Fig. 8(a)) due to the great increment of both flow uniformity and diffusion flux” (Xia et al., 2021, p. 9)

“Chun et al. [38] that the gas permeability of GDL increases when the porosity increases according to their experimental results on LT-PEMFC.” (Xia et al., 2021, p. 9)

“As mentioned above, the optimal porosity would be 35–45\% based on the comprehensive effect of porosity on cell performance. The maximum value of current density can be achieved at a porosity of 40\%,” (Xia et al., 2021, p. 10)},

  abstract = {The 3D (three-dimensional) multi-phase CFD (computational fluid dynamics) model is widely utilized in optimizing water and thermal management of PEM (proton exchange membrane) fuel cell. However, a satisfactory 3D multi-phase CFD model which is able to simulate the detailed gas and liquid two-phase flow in channels and reflect its effect on performance precisely is still not developed due to the coupling difficulties and computation amount. Meanwhile, the agglomerate model of CL (catalyst layer) should also be added in 3D CFD model so as to better reflect the concentration loss and optimize CL structure in macroscopic scale. Besides, the effect of thermal management is perhaps underestimated in current 3D multi-phase CFD simulations due to the lack of coolant channel in computation domain and constant temperature boundary condition. Therefore, the 3D CFD simulations in cell and stack levels with convection boundary condition are suggested to simulate the water and thermal management more accurately. Nevertheless, with the rapid development of PEM fuel cell, current 3D CFD simulations are far from practical demand, especially at high current density and low to zero humidity and for the novel designs developed recently, such as: metal foam flow field, 3D fine mesh flow field, anode circulation etc.},

  abstract = {A three dimensional, electrochemical mathematical model is herein developed to simulate the non-isothermal temperature distribution and two-phase flow for liquid water transport processes in a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). The proposed model includes water phase changes and transport mechanisms in the porous region of the catalyst layer (CL), gas diffusion layer (GDL), and flow channel, and heat transfer within the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) and collector plate. The effects of the relative humidity of inlet gases, operating pressure, and temperature on fuel cell performance are numerically simulated. The results show that relatively high operating pressure increases the oxygen diffusion rate to some degree, which has beneficial effects on fuel cell performance. Meanwhile, relatively high operating temperature increases electrode kinetics and reduces liquid water saturation, which also improves fuel cell performance. Thermal management and water management are essential owing the significant effects that the temperature distribution and liquid water saturation state have on cell performance.},
